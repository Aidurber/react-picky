Yet another React select list.

## Motivation

When dealing with medium+ length select lists, especially multi-select lists. The common approach is to use tags e.g.

Source: [React-Select by Jed Watson](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select)

This approach is fine for smaller lists. When you have options for 20, 30, 100+ options that the use can select, it becomes unmanigable.

For example you have a internal staff mailing list. You want to mail all staff in a department (30 employees). You select all. That would be 30 tags taking unneccessary space.

This is a multiselect with checkboxes, a select all option, and a filter. Along a similar vein as [David Stutz's Bootstrap Multiselect](http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/). There is a port of that library to react with [Skratchdot's React Bootstrap Multiselect](https://github.com/skratchdot/react-bootstrap-multiselect). However I don't want a dependency on jQuery. If you are already using jQuery that might be an alternative for you.

If you like the tag list like [React-Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select), then that would be a great option for you. It's a really great, well-tested library. Give it a look.
