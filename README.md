# Picky â˜œ

Yet another React select list.

## Motivation

When dealing with medium+ length select lists, especially multi-select lists. The common approach is to use tags e.g.

![Tag List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidurber/react-picky/master/readme-tag-list.JPG)

Source: [React-Select by Jed Watson](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select)

This approach is fine for smaller lists. When you have options for 20, 30, 100+ options that the use can select, it becomes unmanigable.

For example you have a internal staff mailing list. You want to mail all staff in a department (30 employees). You select all. That would be 30 tags taking unneccessary space.

This is a multiselect with checkboxes, a select all option, and a filter. Along a similar vein as [David Stutz's Bootstrap Multiselect](http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/). There is a port of that library to react with [Skratchdot's React Bootstrap Multiselect](https://github.com/skratchdot/react-bootstrap-multiselect). However I don't want a dependency on jQuery. If you are already using jQuery that might be an alternative for you.

If you like the tag list like [React-Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select), then that would be a great option for you. It's a really great, well-tested library. Give it a look.

        dropdownHeight={600}
        />
```

## Props

```javascript
Picky.defaultProps = {
  numberDisplayed: 3,
  options: [],
  filterDebounce: 150,
  dropdownHeight: 300,
  onChange: () => {},
  placeholder: 'None selected'
};
Picky.propTypes = {
  placeholder: PropTypes.string,
  value: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.array,
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.number
  ]),
  numberDisplayed: PropTypes.number,
  multiple: PropTypes.bool,
  options: PropTypes.array,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
  open: PropTypes.bool,
  includeSelectAll: PropTypes.bool,
  includeFilter: PropTypes.bool,
  filterDebounce: PropTypes.number,
  dropdownHeight: PropTypes.number,
  onFiltered: PropTypes.func,
  onOpen: PropTypes.func,
  onClose: PropTypes.func,
  valueKey: PropTypes.string,
  labelKey: PropTypes.string
};
```

### Prop descriptions

* `placeholder` - Default message when no items are selected
* `value` - The selected value(s), array if multiple is true.

- `numberDisplayed` - Then number of selected options displayed until it turns into '(selected count) selected'
- `multiple` - Set to true for a multiselect, defaults to false
- `options` - Array of possible options
- `onChange` - Called whenever selected value(s) have changed. This is a controlled component. Pass the selected value back into `value`.
- `open` - Can open or close the dropdown manually. Defaults to false.
- `includeSelectAll` - If set to `true` will add a `Select All` checkbox at the top of the list.
- `includeFilter` - If set to `true` will add an input at the top of the dropdown for filtering the results
- `filterDebounce` - Debounce timeout, used to limit the rate the internal `onFilterChange` gets called. Defaults to 150ms
- `dropdownHeight` - The height of the dropdown. Defaults to 300px.
- `onFiltered` - Called after a filter has been done with the filtered options
- `onOpen` - Called after the dropdown has opened.
- `onClose` - Called after the dropdown has closed.
- `valueKey` - When supplying an array of objects as options, this is required. This specifies which property on the object is the value.
- `labelKey` - When supplying an array of objects as options, this is required. This specifies which property on the object is the label.
  # Internals

The component uses [React Tiny Virtual List](https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list) for rendering out the items. This is a for a performance gain. You can have 1,000,000 items in the dropdown with no performance drop! It's such a great little library. This is why we have a dropdown height.
